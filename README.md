# 468_final

Final project for Montana State EELE 468: SoC FPGA hardware/software design. The goal of this project was to work in a team of 2 people to create a
sound effect using the Cyclone 5 FPGA on the DE-10 Nano development board. This specific project was a pitch shifter using a ring buffer to shift 
the frequency of an audio signal up or down by set amounts.

This project contains:

MATLAB models of the ring buffer and pitch shifter
Simulink models of the pitch shifter that were synthesized into HDL and implemented on the FPGA board
Custom hardware for the FPGA and
